    "# Modeling\n",
    "\n",
    "Modeling in machine learning refers to the process of creating a mathematical representation of a system or phenomenon. This representation, called a model, is then used to make predictions or decisions about new data. There are many types of models, such as linear regression, decision trees, and neural networks, each with their own strengths and weaknesses.\n",
    "\n",
    "When creating a model, it is important to be careful about overfitting, which occurs when a model is too complex and fits the training data too well, but performs poorly on new data. It's also important to be careful about underfitting, which occurs when a model is too simple and doesn't capture the complexity of the system or phenomenon it is trying to represent. Additionally, it's important to be mindful of the potential for bias in the data used to train the model, as well as in the model itself."

    "It is usually applied to the training dataset to balance the class distribution before training a model.It's not applied to the test dataset because the test dataset should be representative of the real-world data that the model will be applied to. The test dataset should be as close as possible to the real-world data, including the class imbalance. In other words, if the real-world data is imbalanced, the test dataset should also be imbalanced.\n",
    "\n",
    "Applying SMOTE to the test dataset would artificially balance the class distribution and give an overestimate of the model's performance. In addition, it would also make the test dataset no longer representative of the real-world data, which would lead to unreliable evaluation of the model's performance. In short, applying SMOTE only to the training dataset and not the test dataset maintains the integrity of the test data and allows for a more accurate evaluation of the model's performance."

    "# XGBoost\n",
    "\n",
    "XGBoost is an implementation of gradient boosting that is used for supervised learning problems, such as classification and regression. It is an ensemble method, which means that it combines the predictions of multiple simpler models to create a more accurate and stable final prediction.\n",
    "\n",
    "The basic idea behind gradient boosting is to fit a sequence of simple models, such as decision trees, to the data and then combine their predictions. Each new model is trained to correct the errors made by the previous models in the sequence. The final prediction is made by combining the predictions of all the models in the sequence.\n",
    "\n",
    "XGBoost uses a specific type of decision tree called a \"gradient tree boosting\" model, which is more efficient than traditional decision trees and can handle *missing data* and *categorical variables*. It also uses a technique called **regularization** to prevent overfitting, which is a common problem when training decision tree models.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### How it works?\n",
    "XGBoost fits the first tree to the data. This tree is called the base learner. The objective of this tree is to fit the data as well as possible. The next step is to add more trees to the ensemble. Each new tree is trained to correct the errors made by the previous trees in the ensemble. The objective of each new tree is to minimize the residual error, which is the difference between the true labels and the current predictions. XGBoost also regularization to prevent overfitting. This is done by adding a penalty term to the objective function that is being minimized. The penalty term is proportional to the complexity of the model, which discourages the model from fitting the noise in the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "The mentioned steps are repeated for a fixed number of iterations or until a stopping criterion is met. After the ensemble of trees is trained, XGBoost makes predictions by combining the predictions of all the trees in the ensemble. The final prediction for a given input is calculated as the weighted sum of the predictions of all the trees, where the weight of each tree is proportional to its importance. XGBoost also provides the feature of fine-tuning the model using techniques like cross-validation, grid search etc."
